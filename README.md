Overview:
This project involves developing a simple text editor in Java. The text editor allows users to create, read, edit, and save text files. The implementation utilizes a modified doubly linked list data structure to manage the text content and cursor position.

Implementation Details:
The project consists of several Java files organized into packages:

main: Contains the implementation of the text editor.
test: Includes test files for verifying the functionality of the text editor.

Files in the main package:
Node.java: Defines the structure of a doubly linked list node holding a character.
Editor.java: Implements the text editor functionality, including cursor management, text insertion, deletion, and file handling.
EditorDisplay.java: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the text editor's operations.
EditorMain.java: Initializes the GUI version of the text editor with various input options.
Files in the test package:
ExampleEditorTests.java: Contains basic tests for the text editor's capabilities, based on provided examples.
StudentEditorTests.java: Contains additional tests to cover edge cases and advanced functionality of the text editor.

Implemented Functionality
The text editor supports the following features:

1. Cursor Management(curPos in Editor.java)
Tracks the position of the cursor within the text.
Allows movement of the cursor left, right, to the beginning, and to the end of the text.

2. Text Insertion(insert() method in Editor.java)
Inserts characters at the cursor position.
Handles insertion at the beginning, end, or middle of the text.

3. Text Deletion(delete() method in Editor.java)
Removes characters at the cursor position using the delete or backspace keys.
Handles deletion at various cursor positions, including the beginning and end of the text.

4. File Handling
Loads text from a file into the editor.
Saves the content of the editor to a file.

How to Use
Run EditorMain.java to open the graphical user interface (GUI) of the text editor.
Use keyboard shortcuts or the provided GUI buttons to perform operations such as inserting, deleting, moving the cursor, saving, and loading files.

Testing
Use ExampleEditorTests.java to run basic tests on the implemented functionality.
Use StudentEditorTests.java to run edge cases.

This readme file provides an overview of the text editor project, including implementation details, 
functionality, usage instructions, and testing guidelines. It serves as a guide for understanding and 
working with the project files effectively.
